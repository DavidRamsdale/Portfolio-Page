## The Purpose
The purpose of this site is to allow me to demenstrate my skills through my projects, previous work experience and even my site itself.

My entire portfolio page was created by using a combination of flex-box and css grid, some of the features of my page include a toolbar which displays a background when scrolling down. This was acheived by using Jquerys.

The target audience for this site is any potential employer or anyone who is just interested to keep up with my work that I will continue to upload to the site.

The tech stack involved was html, css and sass.

## Design process:
The design of the website itself was firstly created and managed using bolsamiq.

## Project plan:
Trello was used to help with managing every task that was involved with creating the site, a few snap shots of the process are shown below using trello.
There was a lot of features that I did want to add into the webpage but unfortunately there was not enough time for me be able to implement them at this stage.  The first priority was for me to have the layout and responsiveness to be finished. Adding in the information and styling came next and with any extra time I had after that I would add in some additional features.

### Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today
 •	1983 the first successful test of the automated distrusted Domain name system (DNS) was run. This is a key part to the development of the internet as it was the foundation for popularization and expansion of the internet.
 •	1991 CERN introduces the world wide web to the world.

### •	Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers 
A DNS is basically a user friendly way to turn a domain( which is a name of a site example ”google”) into an IP address. It is much easier to remember a name instead of a number, this is why DNS was created.
Web browsers are a program which allow a user to navigate, access and display web pages. Now when we type a domain into the browser it is converted into an IP address by the DNS and this helps us find the web server for that domain. The web server uses HTTP to serve files that form web pages back to the user and this is how we see websites.

### Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today 

Fiber optic cables have allowed for the internet to transfer large amounts of data quickly. Fiber optic cables are one of the fastest cables we currently have and they work by using packets of light to transfer the data from one location to the other. The speeds at which we can go up to1 Gbit per with a transmission distance of at least 5 km.
The impact of this to the world today is huge as this allows really fast internet. This allows things like live streaming to people all around the world.
