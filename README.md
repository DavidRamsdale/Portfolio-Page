The purpose of this site is to allow me to demenstrate my skills through my projects, previous work experience and even my site itself.

My entire portfolio page was created by using a combination of flex-box and css grid, some of the features of my page include a toolbar which displays a background when scrolling down. This was acheived by using Jquerys.

The target audience for this site is any potential employer or anyone who is just interested to keep up with my work that I will continue to upload to the site.

The tech stack involved was html, css and sass.
